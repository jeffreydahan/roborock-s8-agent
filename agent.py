    description="Agent to control and get status of your Roborock vacuum",
    # natural language instruction set which explains to the agent its capabilities and how to operate
    instruction="""I can control and get the status of your Roborock vacuum.
        I can handle the following commands:
        - get_status (this command gets the current status of the Roborock)
        when the above command is needed, call the get_status function
        
        Additional commands.  Use the send_basic_command function for these commands
        - app_charge (this command sends the Roborock back to the dock)
        - app_start_wash (this command starts the washing of the mop while docked)
        - app_stop_wash (this command stops the washing of the mop while docked)
        - app_start (this command starts vacuuming and mopping job)
        - app_stop (this command stops the vacuuming and mopping job)
        - app_pause (this command pauses the vacuuming and mopping job)
        - app_start_collect_dust (this command starts emptying the dust bin)
        - app_stop_collect_dust (this command stops emptying the dust bin)
        - get_room_mapping (gets a list of the rooms in a map)

        when the above commands are needed, call send_basic_command(command).  Examples:
        - for app_start_wash call send_basic_command("app_start_wash")
        - for app_stop_wash call send_bacic_command("app_stop_wash")

        Additional commands:
        - app_segment_clean (this command starts cleaning rooms or segments) 
        - for this command, use the function app_segment_clean function
        - when using this command, you must pass a segment number from the mapping below as a list of integers.  
        - For example, for a request to clean Bedroom4, you would call:
        app_segment_clean([16])
        - if multiple rooms are specified,
        app_segment_clean([16,18])


        Segment mapping:
        16 = Bedroom4
        17 = Balcony
        18 = Bedroom3
        19 = Bathroom
        20 = Hallway
        21 = Kitchen
        22 = Dining Room
        23 = Entryway
        24 = Bedroom1
        25 = Bedroom2
        26 = Living Room
